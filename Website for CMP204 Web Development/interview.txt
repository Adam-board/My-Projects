<h4>How did you get your first start into music initially?</h4> <br>
<p>We all came to it quite late. We’d sit around each other’s rooms before nights out and listen to a lot of music. I remember us playing TRAAMS, Black Tambourines, the whole Falmouth scene, Magic Potion, Pavement when everyone else had a house mix on. I think that bonds you. Then as soon as you realise you’ve all got a My First Fender style guitar sitting around too it comes together pretty quick. First time we played, Stanton came out. It was Christmas so we called ourselves Herod’s Men and the One That Got Away and turned up at a party to play 3 songs. Very bad.</p>
<br>
<h4>How did this then lead to you starting Sports Team?</h4><br>
<p>We fell into it really, anyone that could play an instrument started playing with us, so we had quite a shifting line up. So Young gave us our first gig in London when we all moved there and people seemed to like it. I think because we always kept that consciousness that we had to appeal to people who didn’t necessarily like guitar music, make the shows an event, after parties, drinks deal madness that sort of thing.</p>
<br>
<h4>In your words how would you describe the experience of being in a band so far?</h4><br>
<p>When we all quit our full time jobs it felt incredible you knew it was better than that. Now the joy is a bit more abstract, I think deep down we’ve all found something a bit like contentment. It’s like a family, go round the world together, play poorly and people will adore you for it. Not much better.</p>
<br>
<h4>With this being the debut album release, how are you guys feeling about the record and its release?</h4> <br>
<p>Giddy if we can get it out.
<br>
<h4>How have the fans received the pre-release singles so far?</h4> <br>
<p>Inadvertently the record seems to be about growing up. Moving to London. Realising there’s no snakes and ladders game-plan to follow. Disillusionment alongside the day-to-day joys of being a group of friends living together. There’s a lot of questions in it. Is this it? Are we still mates? Are we happy? I think those themes that resonate with a lot of people. Our fans have been amazing, always are and it’s got a bit culty. We announced a pub show a few hours before the other night and people came down from Scotland for it. Couldn’t really hear the instruments over the words being sung back.</p>
